Tigers are also the largest cats in the world, with some males weighing up to 600 pounds! They are solitary animals, meaning they prefer to live and hunt alone rather than in groups.";

Due to her age, blindness, and being overweight at the time, Ethel had been at the shelter for a long time without much adoption interest. After her adoption, her diet was controlled, and she became a healthy eight pounds. Interestingly, Ethel is known to love spinning in circles, especially around meal times, a behavior her owner observed long before the meme made it famous. and then it went viral on the internet, making Ethel a beloved figure online. and then SHE IS NOW THE OIIA CAT MEME LEGEND!!!";
